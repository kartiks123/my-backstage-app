> Personally speaking, I am loving how Backstage is working and what it has to offer. Solving bugs and errors along the way, going into depth why certain features were not running while setting up Backstage or finding out the root cause, intrigued me due to which I am now more interested towards knowing more about it.

# WISHING MYSELF, GOOD LUCK :)
